Orbital is a lightweight desktop environment with class and style that provides tiling window management. Orbital is powered by [skyWM](https://github.com/orbitalde/skywm). skyWM is an extensible tiling Window Manager written in Rust using the [penrose Window Manager library](https://github.com/sminez/penrose).

skyWM has a clear and distinct focus adhering to the KISS and Unix philosophy. Building on that, Orbital provides the user with a small selection of essential applications, and modifications to make skyWM a usable home for you.
